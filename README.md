## Todos
1. Sort messages by voltage levels -- done
2. All monitoring functions should be run in parallel/Series and then after all functions are executed, display all the suggestions -- done
3. Define Global variables to decide category priorities, since we are dealing more than one case now -- done
4. Create a suggestion management framework. For now create a toggle button to strike off a suggestion. To make this possible we should take care that (category, pntId) is unique for a suggestion
